                    <p>
                        Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered 
                        the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to 
                        further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
                    </p>
                    <p> Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen 
                        in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. 
                        As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. 
                        "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for 
                        the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became a true knight.

                    Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. 
                    She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) 
                    as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.

                    <p>
                    After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt invoked the Law of Surprise, 
                    as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.

                        Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. 
                        <br> She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that 
                            she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, 
                        <br> and the youngest member of the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. 
                        <br> After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted 
                        <br> to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

                        Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close 
                        friend of Geralt of Rivia.
                    </p>

                        Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.

                    <p>
                        He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was "beaten into him with a cane". 
                        <br> However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael.
                        <br> Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University 
                        before later becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time 
                        to time to give guest lectures.

                        Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her 
                        contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, 
                        <br> she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, 
                         as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter. Triss took care 
                        of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri 
                        <br> was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never used them on herself because ironically, 
                        she was allergic to potions, and used amulets to treat herself. She was also quite a powerful  
                        <br>mage,certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.
